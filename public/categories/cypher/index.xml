      <description>For several years I have dreamt of ontologies and directed graph structures for representation of the logic in Soil Taxonomy. The express purpose of such work is that computer-aided taxonomy is “easier,” less prone to error, and enables more powerful reasoning about inherently abstract – but reasonably well-defined – concepts.
As an undergraduate in Dr. Schulthess’ soils classes at UCONN – the “graphy-ness” of Soil Taxonomy became apparent to me.</description>
