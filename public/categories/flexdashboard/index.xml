      <description>This is the Shiny &amp;ldquo;flexdashboard&amp;rdquo; version of the &amp;ldquo;pedon summary report&amp;rdquo; originally developed by Dylan Beaudette. I have developed and refined this dashboard periodically over several years. I developed it initially as a very simple interface to semi-automate viewing profile sketches and report generation based on mapunit, series name and taxon kind.

This tool has been part of the ncss-tech soilReports package for a while now, but recent revisions improve efficiency and produce static output matching the original report Dylan developed.</description>
