      <description>This is a demonstration of how to plot water level data from the Henry Mount Soil Climate database with precipitation data from a nearby NOAA weather station.
The demo uses two functions I recently added to the soilDB package (available on GitHub)
 get_NOAA_stations_nearXY- find all stations near a specified latitude/longitude and bounding box (limit 1000)
 get_NOAA_GHCND - get GHCND data (daily summaries) by station IDs, datatypes and years</description>

      <description>CRAN release: soilDB 2.5 https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB
This is a release of soilDB with new functionality and documentation, updates to conform with aqp 1.19, as well as bug-fixes and other quality-of-life enhancements.
 https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/soilDB/index.html http://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/docs/  Notably: we are back on CRAN. Tests and examples have been altered to minimize likelihood of failure on CRAN check farm machines, which has been an on-going issue.
By making tests that contact remote APIs skip if missing the nasis_local ODBC connection, we can effectively filter tests to run only on the local (work) machine.</description>
