      <description>The humus.rocks website has used Drupal 7 for the last 2.5 years. I have only tapped a fraction of the resources that are available to me in the Drupal platform &amp;ndash; using it essentially as a glorified RSS feed aggregator and &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;.
I would much rather write my blogs in markdown &amp;ndash; and then I can extend that to Rmarkdown for my more code-oriented topics or any case where I need to generate some content in a programmatic way.</description>
